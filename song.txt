Clouds

[Verse 1]

Calmly, feel myself evolving
Appalling, so much I'm not divulging
Been stalling, I think I hear applauding, they're calling
Mixtapes aren't my thing, but it's been awfully exhausting
Hanging on to songs this long is daunting (Yeah)
Which caused me to have to make a call I thought was ballsy
Resulting in what you see today, proceed indulging
As always, the one-trick pony's here, so quit your sulking

[Verse 2]

Born efficient, got ambition, sorta vicious—yup, that's me (Woo)
Not artistic, unrealistic, chauvinistic—not those things
Go the distance, so prolific, posts are cryptic, move swiftly
Unsubmissive, the king of mischief, the golden ticket, rare sight to see
I stay committed, embrace the rigid
I'm playful with it, yeah, basically
Too great to mimic, you hate, you're bitter
No favoritism, that's fine with me
Create the riddles, portrayed uncivil
Unsafe a little, oh, yes, indeed
It's plain and simple, I'm far from brittle
Unbreakable, you following?
I'm Bruce Willis in a train wreck
I'm like tradin' in your car for a new jet
I'm like havin' a boss getting upset
'Cause you asked him for less on your paycheck
I'm like doin' headstands with a broke neck
I'm like watchin' your kid take his first steps
I'm like sayin' Bill Gates couldn't pay rent
'Cause he's too broke,— where am I goin' with this?
